#Search Algorithms in C


This project explores the implementation of search algorithms in the C programming language. It covers fundamental concepts such as linear search and binary search, and discusses the importance of selecting the best search algorithm based on specific needs and scenarios.

Overview


The project consists of various tasks aimed at understanding and implementing search algorithms efficiently. Through practical exercises and theoretical discussions, participants will gain a deeper understanding of search algorithms and their applications.

#Learning Objectives


By completing this project, participants will be able to:

Explain the concept of a search algorithm and its significance.
Implement the linear search and binary search algorithms in C.
Analyze the time complexity and space complexity of search algorithms.
Determine the most suitable search algorithm based on specific requirements.
Apply best practices in C programming, including adherence to coding standards and optimization techniques.
